# Refactoring Summary: Autosave & Live Editing

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. **Autosave Implementation**

- **Debounced Save**: Changes are saved automatically 1 second after you stop typing.
- **Smart Logic**: Only saves if the snippet has a title.
- **Empty Content Support**: Now allows saving empty snippets (e.g. "select all and delete" works).
- **State Management**: Fixed cursor jumping issues by tracking snippet ID changes.

### 2. **Clean, Headerless Editor**

- **Removed UI Chrome**: Deleted headers, titles, language indicators, and buttons from `SnippetEditor`.
- **Pure Textarea**: The editor is now a clean, distraction-free text area.
- **Live Editing**: Viewing a snippet now opens it directly in the editor.
- **New Snippet Handling**: A "Save Snippet" button appears _only_ for new, untitled snippets to allow initial saving. Once saved/named, the button disappears and autosave takes over.
- **Stable Language Detection**: Fixed icon flickering by preventing the editor from reverting to 'txt' language while typing.

### 3. **Workbench & Navigation**

- **Unified View**: Replaced `SnippetViewer` with `SnippetEditor` in the Workbench.
- **Direct Access**: Clicking a snippet card now opens it immediately for editing.
- **Simplified Components**: Deleted `SnippetViewer.jsx` and `SnippetViewModal.jsx` as they are no longer needed.
- **Removed Snippets Grid**: The snippets card view has been removed. The application now shows the **Welcome Page** when no snippet is selected, providing a cleaner initial state.
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Changed snippet sorting to **Alphabetical (Title ASC)**. This mimics VS Code behavior where files stay in place during editing and only move if renamed.
- **Seamless Creation**: Removed strict file extension enforcement during autosave, preventing annoying rename prompts and ensuring a smooth transition from creating to editing.

### 4. **Native Module Fixes**

- **Better-SQLite3**: Configured `electron-rebuild` to correctly build the native database module.
- **Electron Version**: Downgraded to Electron v33.0.0 to resolve startup crashes.
- **Rebuild**: Successfully rebuilt native modules for the new Electron version.

## ⚠️ Important: Restart Required

The application main process has been updated to fix the list sorting order. **You must restart the application** (close and reopen) for the sorting changes to take effect.
